## Using `show` Commands

The `show` commands in Cisco IOS provide detailed information about the device's current state and configurations. These are essential for network monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 1. Display Interface Status

To view the status of network interfaces:
```bash
show interfaces
```

This command provides information such as interface speed, status (up/down), errors, and traffic statistics.

### 2. Show IP Routing Table

To view the device's IP routing table:
```bash
show ip route
```

This command displays the routing table, showing how traffic is being routed through the network.

### 3. Show VLAN Information

To check VLAN configurations:
```bash
show vlan brief
```

This command provides an overview of the VLANs configured on the switch.

### 4. Show Access Control Lists (ACLs)

To check applied ACLs:
```bash
show access-lists
```

This will display all ACLs configured on the device, along with their rules.

## Using `debug` Commands

The `debug` commands provide real-time output that can be used for troubleshooting dynamic issues on a Cisco device. Use these commands carefully, as they can impact device performance.

### 1. Debugging Interface Issues

To troubleshoot interface issues such as errors or down status:
```bash
debug interface
```

### 2. Debugging Routing Protocols

To debug routing protocol issues (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP):
```bash
debug ip ospf events
debug ip eigrp neighbors
```

### 3. Debugging ACLs

To debug access control list (ACL) issues:
```bash
debug ip packet
```

This command shows which packets are being allowed or denied by the ACLs.

---

## Troubleshooting VLAN and Trunking Issues

VLAN and trunking issues are common when multiple VLANs are configured across switches.

### 1. Check VLAN Configuration

Use the following command to verify VLAN assignments:
```bash
show vlan brief
```

### 2. Check Trunking Status

To check trunking status between switches:
```bash
show interfaces trunk
```

This command shows the trunking status and which VLANs are allowed on the trunk.

### 3. Verify VLAN Propagation

To ensure VLANs are propagated correctly, use:
```bash
show vtp status
```

---

## Diagnosing Routing Issues

Routing issues are often caused by misconfigurations in routing tables, protocols, or interfaces.

### 1. Check Routing Table

To verify if routes are correctly installed:
```bash
show ip route
```

### 2. Verify Routing Protocols

Ensure routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) are operating correctly:
```bash
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip eigrp neighbors
```

### 3. Verify Interface Status for Routing

Ensure that the interfaces involved in routing are up and correctly configured:
```bash
show ip interface brief
```

---

## Interface and Connectivity Troubleshooting

Network connectivity issues often stem from interface or configuration problems.

### 1. Check Interface Status

Verify if the interface is administratively up:
```bash
show interfaces status
```

### 2. Check Link Lights and Speed

Check the link status and speed settings:
```bash
show interfaces [interface_id] status
```

### 3. Test Connectivity with Ping

Use the `ping` command to test connectivity between devices:
```bash
ping [destination_ip]
```

---

## Troubleshooting Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ACL issues can prevent proper network communication.

### 1. Verify ACLs are Applied Correctly

Use the following command to ensure ACLs are applied to the correct interface:
```bash
show running-config | include access-list
```

### 2. Check ACL Hit Counts

To verify how many times an ACL rule is triggered:
```bash
show access-lists
```

This will display counters for each ACL entry.

---

## Monitoring Network Performance

To ensure the network is operating optimally, regular monitoring is essential.

### 1. Check CPU Utilization

To check the CPU usage of the device:
```bash
show processes cpu
```

### 2. Check Memory Usage

To monitor memory usage:
```bash
show memory statistics
```

### 3. Monitor Network Traffic

To check the amount of traffic passing through the interfaces:
```bash
show interfaces [interface_id] counters
```

---

## Using Syslog for Monitoring

Syslog servers collect log messages from Cisco devices, which helps in monitoring network health and troubleshooting.

### 1. Configure Syslog Server

To configure a syslog server:
```bash
logging host [syslog_server_ip]
logging trap informational
```

### 2. View Syslog Messages

To view the latest syslog messages locally:
```bash
show logging
```

Monitoring and troubleshooting Cisco devices are essential tasks for ensuring network reliability and performance. By using the `show` and `debug` commands, you can quickly identify issues and take corrective action. Regular monitoring of key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, as well as network traffic, can help you stay ahead of potential problems.
