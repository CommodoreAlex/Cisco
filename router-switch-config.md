# Router and Switch Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer & Real-World)

## Introduction

Configuring Cisco routers and switches is a fundamental skill for network engineers and system administrators. This guide covers essential commands and best practices for **both Packet Tracer and real-world devices** to help you manage Cisco network infrastructure effectively.

## 0. Networking Cables / Interfaces

**Interfaces** are the ports on a router, switch, or other device that allow communication with other devices on the network.

- **Physical Interfaces**: These are actual ports (e.g., `GigabitEthernet0/1`) where you plug in network cables like Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6).
- **Logical Interfaces**: Virtual ports, such as loopback or VLAN interfaces, that donâ€™t correspond to physical connections.

**Network Cables**: These connect the physical interfaces of different devices, enabling them to send and receive data.

Example:
1. A **router** interface (`GigabitEthernet0/1`) is connected to a **switch** via a network cable.
2. Data flows from the routerâ€™s interface, through the cable, to the switch.
3. The switch then sends the data to connected devices (e.g., computers) via its own interfaces.

In short: **Interfaces are the ports on devices, and network cables physically connect them to enable communication.**

ðŸ’¡ **Packet Tracer Tip**:  
To connect devices in Packet Tracer, use the **"Connections" tool**. Select the appropriate cable (e.g., **straight-through cable** for a router to switch, **crossover cable** for connecting two routers) and click on the devices to establish the connection.

Types of networking cables:
- **Straight-Through**: Different devices (router to switch, computer to switch).
- **Crossover**: Similar devices (router to router, switch to switch).
- **Fiber Optic**: High-speed, long-distance communication.
- **Coaxial**: Older networking and cable TV.
- **Patch Cable**: Short connections (typically straight-through).
- **USB Cable**: Device management and configuration.
## 1. Configuring a Router

### 1.1 Assigning an IP Address to an Interface

To configure an IP address on a router interface:
```bash
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
```

Verify with:
```bash
show ip interface brief
```

ðŸ’¡ **Packet Tracer Tip:**

- Click the router, go to the **CLI tab**, and enter the above commands.
- Use the **"Connections" tool** and select a **crossover cable** when connecting two routers.

### 1.2 Setting Up Static Routing

For small networks, static routes are useful:
```bash
configure terminal
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
exit
```

Verify with:
```bash
show ip route
```

ðŸ’¡ **Packet Tracer Tip:**

- Ensure that the **next-hop router** has a corresponding return route.
- Use **pings** to test connectivity between networks.

### 1.3 Configuring Dynamic Routing (OSPF Example)

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol used to find the best path for data transmission within an IP network by exchanging routing information between routers.

For larger networks, dynamic routing is preferred:
```bash
configure terminal
router ospf 1
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
exit
```

Verify with:
```bash
show ip ospf neighbor
```

ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Insight:**

- OSPF automatically **learns** new routes, reducing manual configuration.
- Ensure all OSPF routers have **matching area numbers**.

## 2. Configuring a Switch

### 2.1 Assigning a Hostname

```bash
configure terminal
hostname Switch01
exit
```

### 2.2 Setting Up VLANs

Creating VLANs to segment network traffic:
```bash
configure terminal
vlan 10
name Sales
exit
vlan 20
name IT
exit
```

Verify VLANs:
```bash
show vlan brief
```

ðŸ’¡ **Packet Tracer Tip:**

- Use the **"Add PC"** tool and assign VLANs using **static IPs** to simulate network segmentation.

### 2.3 Assigning VLANs to Ports

```bash
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
exit
```

Verify port VLAN assignment:
```bash
show interfaces GigabitEthernet0/1 switchport
```

ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Insight:**

- VLANs help isolate network traffic, improving security and performance.
- Ensure inter-VLAN routing is enabled via a **Layer 3 device (Router-on-a-Stick or L3 switch).**

### 2.4 Configuring Trunk Ports

A trunk port is a network port that carries traffic for multiple VLANs, allowing the switch to transmit data for different VLANs over a single link.

To allow VLAN traffic between switches:
```bash
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/24
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
exit
```

Verify trunk configuration:
```bash
show interfaces trunk
```

ðŸ’¡ **Packet Tracer Tip:**

- Use the **"Connections" tool** and select a **straight-through cable** when connecting **switches** via trunk links.

### 2.5 Enabling SSH Access

```bash
configure terminal
ip domain-name example.com
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
username admin privilege 15 secret Cisco123
line vty 0 4
transport input ssh
login local
exit
```

Verify SSH access:
```bash
show ip ssh
```

ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Insight:**

- **Disable Telnet** and use only **SSH** for secure remote access.
- Ensure **SSH version 2** is enabled for enhanced security.

To disable Telnet on a switch or router in Packet Tracer, you can follow these steps:

### 3.0 Disabling Telnet Access

Enter global configuration mode:
```bash
Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
```

Disable Telnet by disabling the VTY (Virtual Terminal) lines:
```bash
Switch(config)# no transport input telnet
```

(Optional) You can also secure the VTY lines by requiring a password:
```bash
Switch(config)# line vty 0 15
Switch(config-line)# password yourpassword
Switch(config-line)# login
```

Exit configuration mode:
```bash
Switch(config-line)# exit
Switch(config)# exit
```

Now Telnet will be disabled for all remote access to the device.

## 3. Saving and Managing Configurations

### 3.1 Saving the Configuration

```bash
write memory
```

Or:
```bash
copy running-config startup-config
```

### 3.2 Restoring a Saved Configuration

```bash
copy startup-config running-config
```

### 3.3 Resetting to Factory Defaults

```bash
write erase
reload
```

Whether you're working in a simulated lab or configuring production hardware, these commands provide a strong foundation for managing Cisco routers and switches.
