## Securing Cisco Devices

Securing Cisco devices is the first step in protecting your network infrastructure. Whether in a real network or a simulated Packet Tracer environment, these steps will help secure your routers, switches, and access points:

### 1. Change Default Passwords

Always change default usernames and passwords to strong, complex credentials to prevent unauthorized access. This is one of the most effective methods to prevent attacks in both real-world and simulation scenarios.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
enable secret MyStrongPassword123
```

### 2. Configure Device Access

Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) and user authentication methods to control access to the device. This ensures that only authorized users or devices can connect.

**Example ACL in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 1 permit any
line vty 0 4
  access-class 1 in
```

### 3. Enable Device Logging

Configure logging to track any access or configuration changes made to the device. It's important to regularly monitor logs to detect potential security incidents.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
logging buffered 4096
logging console
logging trap informational
```

## Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

AAA is a framework that helps manage user access, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting for network devices.

### 1. Configure AAA Authentication

Enable AAA for centralized user authentication in real-world and Packet Tracer environments. This ensures secure access for all users.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default local
```

### 2. Set Up Local User Database

Add local users for authentication. This is essential when testing in Packet Tracer or setting up actual Cisco devices.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
username admin password MySecurePassword
```

## Enabling SSH and Disabling Telnet

Telnet is an insecure protocol and should always be disabled in favor of SSH, which encrypts the connection. This is applicable to both real-life Cisco devices and Packet Tracer setups.

### 1. Disable Telnet

Disable Telnet and enforce SSH for secure communication.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
line vty 0 4
  transport input ssh
```
#### Breakdown of the Command:
- **`line vty 0 4`**  
    This specifies that you are configuring **VTY lines 0 through 4**, which are the default virtual terminal lines used for remote access (typically allowing up to 5 concurrent sessions).
- **`transport input ssh`**  
    This restricts remote access to **only SSH** (Secure Shell), preventing the use of less secure protocols like Telnet. If you don't specify `ssh`, the default would allow Telnet as well.
### 2. Enable SSH

Configure SSH for encrypted remote access. This prevents sensitive data from being transmitted in plaintext.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
ip domain-name MyNetwork.com
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
line vty 0 4
  transport input ssh
```

## Securing SNMP

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) can expose sensitive information if not properly secured. Follow these steps to secure SNMP in real devices or simulations like Packet Tracer.

### 1. Disable SNMP if not needed

Disabling SNMP helps prevent unauthorized users from gaining insight into device configuration.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
no snmp-server community public
no snmp-server community private
```

### 2. Secure SNMP v3

SNMPv3 offers better security with encryption and authentication compared to earlier versions.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
snmp-server group MyGroup v3 priv
snmp-server user MyUser MyGroup v3 auth sha MyAuthPassword priv aes 128 MyPrivPassword
```

#### Breakdown of the Command:
- `group MyGroup v3 priv` → Creates an SNMPv3 group with **privacy (encryption)**.
- `user MyUser MyGroup v3 auth sha MyAuthPassword priv aes 128 MyPrivPassword`  
    → Adds a user with **SHA authentication** and **AES-128 encryption**.

#### Why This Matters?
- **SNMPv1 & v2c** transmit data in **plain text** (easily intercepted).
- **SNMPv3** ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and authentication**.
- If **SNMP isn't required**, disabling it reduces attack surface.

## Using Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

Firewalls and IPS are essential for protecting networks from external and internal threats. In real-world networks and Packet Tracer simulations, these devices provide proactive defense against attacks.

### 1. Configure ACLs for Firewalls

Create ACLs to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on IP addresses or subnets. This is crucial for controlling access and blocking unauthorized traffic.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
access-list 101 deny ip any any log
```

### 2. Enable Intrusion Prevention

Configure IPS to monitor and prevent malicious activity across the network. While Packet Tracer may not have an IPS feature, it's important to know how to configure it in real-world setups.

**Example in real devices:**
```bash
ip ips configure name MyIPS
```

---

## Configuring Logging

Proper logging helps identify security events such as unauthorized access attempts and configuration changes.

### 1. Configure Syslog Servers

Set up a syslog server to send logs for centralized monitoring. This helps track and manage logs effectively.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
logging host 192.168.1.100
logging trap debugging
```

### 2. Monitor Log Messages

Regularly monitor log messages to detect any unusual behavior or security incidents.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
show logging
```

## Securing Access Control

Access control is essential for restricting unauthorized access to network devices and resources. This is important for both real and simulated Cisco devices.

### 1. Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC allows you to define user roles and restrict access to specific device functions.

Cisco IOS has **16 privilege levels (0-15)** to control user access:

|**Level**|**Access**|
|---|---|
|**0**|Minimal commands (`disable`, `enable`, `exit`, `logout`)|
|**1**|Basic User EXEC mode (view-only commands, no changes)|
|**2-14**|Customizable (assign specific commands for role-based access)|
|**15**|Full administrative access (all commands, configuration changes)|

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
username admin privilege 15 secret MyAdminPassword # Full admin access
username guest privilege 1 secret MyGuestPassword # View-only access
```

#### Custom Privilege Level 5 Example
```bash
enable secret level 5 MyLevel5Password
username junior privilege 5 secret MyJuniorPassword
privilege exec level 5 show running-config
```

- **Creates** user `junior` with **privilege 5**.
- **Allows only** `show running-config` command.

**How to Log In as 'junior'**
1. Enter **`junior`** as the username and password at login.
2. Type **`enable 5`**, then enter **`MyLevel5Password`**.
3. Run **`show running-config`** (other commands are restricted).

#### Cisco Privilege Levels – Assignable Commands

Below is a table of common commands that can be assigned to custom levels.

| **Command Type**        | **Example Commands**                 | **Assignable?** (Yes/No) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Basic Commands**      | `show`, `ping`, `traceroute`         | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Debugging**           | `debug`, `show running-config`       | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Configuration Mode**  | `configure terminal`                 | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Interface Config**    | `interface`, `ip address`            | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Routing**             | `router ospf`, `network`             | ✅ Yes                    |
| **VLAN & Switching**    | `vlan database`, `switchport mode`   | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Access Control**      | `access-list`, `NAT`, `QoS`          | ✅ Yes                    |
| **User Management**     | `username`, `enable secret`          | ✅ Yes                    |
| **File & System Mgmt**  | `copy`, `delete`, `write memory`     | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Full Admin Commands** | `reload`, `write erase`, `debug all` | ❌ No (Level 15 Only)     |

Example: Assign "show running-config" to Level 5
```bash
privilege exec level 5 show running-config
```

### 2. Use Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ACLs can filter network traffic and control access to resources based on defined rules.

**Example in Packet Tracer:**
```bash
access-list 101 permit ip host 192.168.1.1 any
```
