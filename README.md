## Overview  

**What is Cisco Networking?**  

Cisco networking refers to the design, implementation, and management of networks using **Cisco routers, switches, and firewalls**. Cisco is a leader in network solutions, providing hardware and software that power enterprise and cloud-based infrastructure worldwide.  

This guide covers the basics of **network setup, configuration, and security**, helping system administrators effectively manage Cisco devices.

## Networking Basics  

Before configuring Cisco devices, itâ€™s essential to understand networking fundamentals:  

- **OSI and TCP/IP Models**  
- **IP Addressing and Subnetting**  
- **MAC Addressing and ARP**  
- **Switching vs. Routing**  
- **DNS, DHCP, and NAT**  

Learn more in [NETWORKING_BASICS.md](networking-basics.md).

## Cisco Device Setup  

Learn how to set up Cisco routers and switches from scratch, including:  

- **Console and SSH access**  
- **Basic CLI commands** (`show`, `configure terminal`, `enable`)  
- **Saving configurations (`write memory`)**  
- **Upgrading IOS firmware**  

Step-by-step instructions are in [CISCO_DEVICE_SETUP.md](cisco-device-setup.md).  

---

## Router and Switch Configuration  

This section covers essential **Cisco device configurations**, including:  

- **Assigning IP addresses to interfaces**  
- **Configuring static and dynamic routing**  
- **Enabling SSH and disabling insecure protocols**  
- **Basic switch setup (hostname, VLANs, trunking)**  

Check out [ROUTER_SWITCH_CONFIG.md](router-switch-config.md) for more details.  

---

## VLANs and Subnetting  

Organizing networks with VLANs and subnetting helps **improve performance and security**:  

- **Creating and managing VLANs**  
- **Inter-VLAN routing with Layer 3 switches**  
- **Subnetting best practices**  

Detailed steps in [VLANS_SUBNETTING.md](vlans-subnetting.md).  

---

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)  

Learn how to **control network traffic** using ACLs:  

- **Standard vs. Extended ACLs**  
- **Inbound and Outbound rules**  
- **Applying ACLs to interfaces**  
- **Blocking or allowing specific IPs and protocols**  

More details in [ACCESS_CONTROL_LISTS.md](access-control-lists.md).  

---

## Routing Protocols  

Cisco devices use routing protocols to **find the best path** for network traffic:  

- **Static vs. Dynamic Routing**  
- **Configuring RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF**  
- **Route summarization and redistribution**  
- **BGP (for advanced setups)**  

Find step-by-step guidance in [ROUTING_PROTOCOLS.md](routing-protocols.md).  

---

## Network Security  

Securing Cisco devices and network infrastructure is critical:  

- **Enabling SSH and disabling Telnet**  
- **Configuring AAA authentication**  
- **Using Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**  
- **Securing SNMP and logging**  

Check out [NETWORK_SECURITY.md](network-security.md) for security best practices.  

---

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting  

Ensure network stability by learning **Cisco troubleshooting commands**:  

- **Using `show` and `debug` commands**  
- **Troubleshooting VLAN and trunking issues**  
- **Checking routing tables and ACLs**  
- **Diagnosing interface and connectivity issues**  

For common troubleshooting steps, refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](troubleshooting.md).  

---

## Backup and Recovery  

To prevent **network downtime**, always have a backup strategy:  

- **Saving and restoring Cisco configurations**  
- **Using TFTP or FTP for IOS upgrades**  
- **Recovering lost passwords**  

Backup methods are explained in [BACKUP_RECOVERY.md](backup-recovery.md).
